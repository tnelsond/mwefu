\chapter{Charles Barfoot's Continuation}
\section{Conspiracies}
I found Bob Graft's additions (Appendix C and D) crumpled up in the trash. I don't think he wanted anyone to read them, but wouldn't it'd be funny if they somehow ended up in the finished book? Bob is never going to read this book anyway, so I can probably get away with almost anything.

I'm going to pick up where Bob left off, but there's going to be some significant differences:
\begin{enumerate}
\item I don't care about texts, languages, footnotes and other irrelevant distractions from the story.
\item I care about the story. Bob's idea of a good story is the dictionary.
\item I have no idea what is supposed to happen next in the story, but I'll just do my best to make up something interesting. You may not like it, that's your right.
\end{enumerate}

Captain Seaweed lumbered towards the throne and sat himself down on it.
``I'm the king now," He said, ``any questions?''

The old king, who I'll call Kevin, rallied the soldiers to attack king Seaweed.

``Seaweed is going to stop the Kaaji tribute and leave this nation poor!'' Said Kevin.

``Captain Seaweed is a ruthless man who killed lots of innocent people and conspired against the country. He actually makes Mwefu look innocent.'' Said Twizwa.

``That's fair.'' Said King Seaweed, ``But I'm not the same person I was.''

``You're right, you're old and washed up --'' Said Kevin.

``Was that supposed to be an insult?'' Interrupted Seaweed, ``Because I beat all you easily. What does that make you?''

King Seaweed stood up and four guards rushed towards him and lept upon him; but Seaweed threw them off and entered his palace.

``Something is going on here.'' Said Kevin, ``There's no way he could beat me in a fair fight.''

``He just brushed off four fighting men like they were nothing.'' Said Twizwa, ``That's not natural skill. Some kind of evil is afoot inside him no doubt. I propose the four of us (Kevin, Mwefu, Naazwato, and myself) team up to take him down before he ruins everything.''

``It only took you three men 12 seconds to go from patriots to traitors.'' Muttered Mwefu.

``Touch\'{e}. So you're on our side?'' Said Twizwa.

``Might as well.'' Said Mwefu.

``Still can't believe you were Mwefu the whole time.'' Said Naazwato.

So the quartet schemed and set out to assassinate the king. Twizwa still had his position as second in command, so he convinced the cup bearer to poison king Seaweed.

Twizwa watched as Seaweed guzzled down a glass of wine. ``Trevor, this is an excellent drink, what did you put in this? It tastes wonderful.'' The king said as he handed the remainder of the glass to his cup bearer.

``Take a sip, it's got quite a kick to it.'' Seaweed suggested. Trevor was confused, but thinking he had accidentally developed a novel wine instead of poisoning the king as he had hoped, he took a drink. But Trevor had not made a mistake, it was indeed poisoned; he convulsed and died. 

``Trevor! Are you alright? What have I done?!'' Cried Seaweed, ``How was I supposed to know that it'd be too strong for you?'' Twizwa ran up to the corpse and confirmed that he was indeed dead.

Seaweed, however, picked Trevor up and slapped him. Life shot back into the cup bearer's face as Seaweed told him to be more careful. 

Because that plan failed, Twizwa met secretly with Mwefu, Naazwato, and Kevin. He told them what happened.

``Was the poison faulty?'' Asked Mwefu.

``No.'' Said Twizwa, ``That was the finest poison in the greatest quality. No one could have survived it.'' 

``Perhaps he was immune.'' Said Naazwato.

``You're so naive, it doesn't work that way. That would be like saying that he's immune to beheading.'' Said Twizwa.

``But Trevor survived a small sip.''

``No! He was dead.''

``Then what happened?!'' Asked Kevin.

``Power must have went out of Seaweed and into the cup bearer when he slapped him.'' Said Twizwa.

``I doubt it.'' Said Mwefu, ``Everything can be explained in the natural. Snakes are a much more reliable deliverer of venom.''

So they bought ten different kinds of venomous snakes and Twizwa let them out in the king's bedroom while he was sleeping.

The next morning Twizwa went to see if the king was dead. Twizwa was wearing full armor so that none of the snakes could bite him. The king wasn't breathing. Twizwa moved closer to be sure he was dead; but the king twitched, snorted, and started snoring. Twizwa pulled back the covers to find the ten snakes cuddled up with the king but it didn't look like any had bitten him. So Twizwa shook the king's bed and said, ``King Seaweed! Some fiend has put venomous serpents in your bed!'' A loud slithering could be heard and the king got up and let out a few cries.

``Darn snakes.'' He said getting out of bed. All ten snakes were latched onto his body and he shook them off, and lifeless they hit the ground.

``Good thing you're wearing armor.'' Said Seaweed, ``You could have been bitten, let me tell you, it stings.''

``You'll probably die.'' Said Twizwa sitting down in a chair as Seaweed got up and put on his kingly robes.

``If I could be so lucky.'' Scoffed the king taking no mind of it. He walked to the throne room and sat on his chair and began reading through piles of reports and notes.

``We have to do something about the beggars, Twizwa.''

``Give them more money.'' Said Twizwa.

``If only it were that easy. A dependence on other people's labors makes them lazy so they don't value the money and they waste it on frivolity. We need to encourage working and craftsmanship.''

``You just don't want to give them the treasure. Where's your heart?''

``I don't know, how 'bout you go find it while I get some work done.''

So the king went out to tour the kingdom while Twizwa stayed behind and studied.

\section{Captain Seaweed}

Twizwa read some books on astronomy, astrology, aardvarks, and finally he got to one about pirates.

Here's the part he read about Captain Seaweed:

As a boy, Sarnu was going by ship to the Indies with his parents when they got shipwrecked on an abandoned island. His father and mother tamed the wild island and it became quite hospitable, but still they died of disease eight years later. Sarnu by now was a young man.

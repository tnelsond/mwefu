\section{Barfoot Interrupts Himself}
I'm sorry for doing this, I don't normally interrupt the flow of a story, but I thought it was important to get this out here.

Not sure why I put so many love stories into that last section, maybe it had to do with my infatuation and falling out with Bob Graft's daughter, I don't know.

I had been seeing his daughter a lot and Bob invited me over for dinner one night; I had no idea the kind of mess I was about to find myself in.

I arrived at his house at 5:30pm, 30 minutes early so that I wouldn't be late. The house was in shambles, the soffits were hanging and dented, the fascia boards were rotted, and the hedges were unruly and were being overtaken by wild grapes and mulberries. Bob's wife Mary answered the old wooden door that was in need of a new paint job.

``Oh, you're early!'' She said flustered and slamming the door on me, ``Give me five minutes to finish tidying up.''

So I waited outside and cleaned up some garbage myself and found a rusty pair of loppers and began to trim the plants.

``What do you think you're doing!'' Asked Graft, sneaking up behind me.

``I'm just trimming some weeds.'' I replied.

``Those aren't weeds, those are valuable trees, the world is running short on trees.'' He shot back.

``I'm sorry. They didn't look wanted.'' I replied. He grabbed the loppers out of my hand and threw them back on the ground where I had picked them up from; then he led me inside. Bob was a man of 50 years, as was his wife.
The house was fairly messy, so I couldn't imagine what it had looked like before they cleaned it.
Bob sat me down at the table which was set for four and I could smell the spaghetti and Texas toast.

A loud mumble came from the other room. Bob twitched in annoyance.

``Honey.'' Shouted Mary from the kitchen, ``Dad wants you to help him to the kitchen.''
I thought that Mary was talking to Anne their daughter, but Bob spoke up.

``He was supposed to be napping.'' He said with agitation in his voice as he got up and went into the other room. He returned with his arm around a thin wrinkled old man. Bob sat the man down at the table and went to grab another chair and plate et cetera.

``You must be my future grandson.'' Said the old man.

``I don't know about that. So you're Bob's Dad?'' I replied.

``Step father.'' Said Bob interrupting the same as he scooted the old man and his chair aside so that there was room for himself to wedge a chair in.

``Tell me. Have you ever heard of a book called \emph{The Fall of King Mwefu}?'' Said the step father.

``Now let's not bring this up, Al.'' Said Bob.

``Yes I have.'' I replied, ``It's a great story.''

``Ah yes.'' Said Al grinning, ``But which is your favorite translation?''

``I've only read the original.'' I said.

``The original Fobwa?'' Asked Bob seeming to lighten up.

``No. The Pacoitz translation.'' I said, ``I tried the other translations, but I could never get into them.'' Al smiled at this answer and Bob's countenance sunk.

``Why must you do this?'' Said Mary setting the pot of spaghetti down on the table, ``Can we please talk about something else? Especially when we have company.''

``Oh come on. I hear that I'm all that Bob talks about at work.'' Said Al.

``No, I didn't even know he had a stepdad.'' I said.

``I'm Allen G. Pacoitz. I was the first to discover and translate \emph{The Fall of King Mwefu}.'' Said Al.

``Oh.'' I replied, ``Then yes he talks about you, but he's never told any of us that you he personally knew you, let alone that you lived in his house and were his stepdad.''

``My house.'' Said Al, ``But yeah, that's funny, Bobby is such a hoot. I'm not sure who has more shame though, him of me, or I of him.''

``You're insufferable.'' Said Bob.

``Don't mind Bob, that's his little mind's way of saying that he loves me.'' Said Al.

``Why did you have to ruin a great work of literature by doing such a poor job translating it?!'' Said Bob.

``I made it better. Charlie agrees with me.'' Said Al, ``Now would someone go get some apricot jam please?'' I got up to look for some jam in the refrigerator, but Bob stopped me.

``No! You can't let him put jam on cheesy bread. Those flavors don't go together.'' He said. But I handed Al the jam and he poured nearly the whole jar on his Texas toast.

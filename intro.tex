\chapter*{Note from the Typesetter}

Charles gave me this copy out of the trash and it's actually better than Graft's finished copy, so I'm substituting that with this.

I've been a typesetter here for 7 months, which is 5 months longer than everyone before me. Every day Robert Graft spouts out the same old offensive opinions as if his one goal in life is to make me go mad.

Serendipitously, as if by fate, I found this earlier manuscript littered with excessive and offensive and personal notes from Graft. I'd like the world to know what he's really like and the torment everyone has endured; so I'm including Graft's notes and forwards and editorial notes so as to get revenge.

By the time I'm caught for this it will already be too late. Graft won't read this, because he thinks that the final version has very few of his notes; and I plan on quitting this job anyway.

I must admit, this is quite hilarious.

\chapter*{Foreword by the Editor}
\emph{The Fall of King Mwe\-fu} is a good story; except this translation is not.
It may have seemed like a decent enough translation back in 1909 when Allen G. Pa\-co\-itz first translated it and he was the only scholar who could even read the language of Fo\-bwa.
Nevertheless, many people, who were intrigued by the story, learned to read Fo\-bwa so that they could enjoy \emph{The Fall of King Mwe\-fu} in its original language.
And when they did, they realized that Pa\-co\-itz was inserting his own ideas and removing important content as if he were a mad man.
The only reason this edition even exists is because despite the protest of many Fo\-bwa scholars, Pa\-co\-itz's translation is still the most popular translation in schools and in the home. 

There are now many more scholars studying the Fo\-bwa language and we now have much better translations;
do yourself a favor, drop this book right now and go out and buy \emph{The Fall of King Mwe\-fu: Faithful Edition} from \emph{Whinery Press}, it is true to the original work, and in the opinion of many is a much much better narrative.
Actually I don't really even care if you buy it from us at \emph{Whinery Press} or not.
As long as it's not translated by Allen G. Pa\-co\-itz you should be fine.
Note, however, that due to the nature of the Fo\-bwa language (and its total lack of word order) other publishers might call their translations \emph{King Shunwe's Descension} or any number of things. The name Mwe\-fu itself could also be rendered (using the Pa\-co\-itz phonology) as Nweshu, Hungwe, or Fumwe; and there are also completely different phonologies out there such as the Joshua phonology where the sounds are scientifically reconstructed from phrases that are thought to be borrowed from Hebrew; so this is something to look out for in other publishers' translations. In \emph{The Fall of King Mwe\-fu: Faithful Edition} most of the names differ from Pa\-co\-itz's because he had absolutely no consistency. Sometimes Pa\-co\-itz used the verb form of a name or worse, half the name would be in one form and the other half of it would be in another; sometimes he'd ignore putting the name in all together and substitute it with an unrelated English noun.

If for some reason you actually want to read this edition, for historical purposes or some other nonsense, then by all means read my footnotes where I point out all of Pa\-co\-itz's inaccuracies. And whenever I refer to the \emph{original} I'm referring to the original Fo\-bwa text.

\chapter{Maps}
\section{Pa\-co\-itz'}
I don't need to tell you that Pa\-co\-itz' map is worthless; there is only two place names written on the whole thing, the terrain is vague and there is only two rivers? I think Pa\-co\-itz just made this up, but he didn't even make it up based off of the places described in the text.

\section{Graft's}
I grew tired of looking at Pa\-co\-itz' map so I made my own using hints from the text. It's more accurate and way more informative, however, I did take some liberties.

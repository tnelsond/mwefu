``When are they going to execute you?'' Asked Seaweed.

``It's strange.'' Said Mwe\-fu, ``I have no idea.''

``They postponed your execution so that you could kill me.''

``It seems to be. That doesn't bother you at all?''

``If it's my time to die, it's my time to die.''

``I don't understand it.'' Said Mwe\-fu, ``You were able to leave your old life of sorcery and treachery and move on, but my past is always going to haunt me and I can't commit myself to a side.''

``Of course you can't.'' Said Seaweed, ``If you're fighting yourself you're going to lose. Or at best you'll be stuck at a stalemate, you need help.''

``Even if I could stick to a side, I've still lost everyone's trust. I want what you have, that spirit that gives you power and peace.''

``Ok.'' Said Seaweed touching Mwe\-fu on the shoulder, ``There you go.''

``That's it?'' Said Mwe\-fu, ``Nothing happened. I don't feel any different.''

``Why would you feel any different?''

``I just thought that I'd feel a sensation or something.''

``Walk by faith. Not by sight. If you rely on your feelings to guide you then you're going to be in trouble.''

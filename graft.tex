\chapter{Robert Graft Finishes the Story}
\emph{Whinery Press} does not have any other translations of \emph{The Fall of King Mwefu} licensed for use in this book, so I have paraphrased the parts of the story which the reader has been deprived of because Pacoitz left them out.

So I trained Naazwato. I purchased a book on fighting at Naazwato's request, however, up reading it, I found that the contents themselves were pretty near worthless; pages and pages of names and dates and battles. There wasn't a technique or a strategy espoused in the entire volume which would be useful; all the better -- I would substitute my words for its own.

While pretending that I was reading the lessons out of the book, I taught Naazwato many skills such as: sword disarming, kickboxing, and various dodging maneuvers.  We also went to the tailor and the blacksmith to have Naazwato's armor properly fitted.

``I don't understand it,'' Cried the tailor, ``your armor is all different sizes. Your mail shirt is too baggy, your breastplate is too tight, and your boots are just wooden blocks.''

``How dare you! I -- I --'' Said Naazwato.

``They were on sale.'' I said, interrupting him.

``The whole set would cost more to fix than to make new.'' Said the tailor.

``How much?'' Asked Naazwato.

``40 gold units.'' 

``And for new?''

``20 gold units.'' So because Naazwato only had 5 gold units, we left. On the way out we were stopped by an old woman.

``Come with me.'' She said.

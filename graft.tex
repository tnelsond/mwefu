\chapter{Robert Graft Finishes the Story}
\emph{Whinery Press} does not have any other translations of \emph{The Fall of King Mwefu} licensed for use in this book, so I have paraphrased the parts of the story which the reader has been deprived of because Pacoitz left them out.

So I trained Naazwato. I purchased a book on fighting at Naazwato's request, however, up reading it, I found that the contents themselves were pretty near worthless; pages and pages of names and dates and battles. There wasn't a technique or a strategy espoused in the entire volume which would be useful; all the better -- I would substitute my words for its own.

While pretending that I was reading the lessons out of the book, I taught Naazwato many skills such as: sword disarming, kickboxing, and various dodging maneuvers.  We also went to the tailor and the blacksmith to have Naazwato's armor properly fitted.

``I don't understand it,'' Cried the tailor, ``your armor is all different sizes. Your mail shirt is too baggy, your breastplate is too tight, and your boots are just wooden blocks.''

``How dare you! I -- I --'' Said Naazwato.

``They were on sale.'' I said, interrupting him.

``The whole set would cost more to fix than to make new.'' Said the tailor.

``How much?'' Asked Naazwato.

``40 gold units.'' 

``And for new?''

``20 gold units.'' So because Naazwato only had 5 gold units, we left. On the way out we were stopped by an old woman.

``Come with me.'' She said. The old lady took us to an old house in the woods on the border of the lead hills.

``You don't want metal armor, it's too heavy and easy to cut and deform.'' She said.

``Then pray tell, what could we possibly want? Leather?!'' Said Naazwato.

``No.'' Said the old woman followed by a fit of laughter, ``You want wood.''

``But wood is flammable and fragile.'' Said I.

``Not all wood. You've heard of iron wood? Well that won't do. I'm the only worker of something much better, diamond wood.'' She showed us to a small grove of a dozen trees with glittering bark. The old woman handed Naazwato an axe and bid him to fell one of the trees. He swung the axe at the tree, but the strike left the tree unscratched and Naazwato's hands bleeding and his mouth cursing. The old woman laughed,
``It's funny every time. See? Iron can't harm this wood.'' 
``Then what can?!'' Demanded Naazwato still rolling on the ground.
``Oh I won't tell you, but I will make you a suit of it if you can bring me three things --''
``I hate it when this happens.'' I said aside to Naazwato.
``First I need an orange pear, a shoe from the most beautiful woman in ???, and a lock of Mwefu's hair.''
``Why do you need that garbage?'' Asked Naazwato, ``Are you a witch?''
``No.'' She said laughing again, ``I'm just a sentimental old woman.''

So the two of us departed to find those things. We found the pear from an exotic fruit merchant -- It was mostly orange. We inquired about and found that the most beautiful woman was actually a cobbler, so we tried to buy a shoe from her. But she protested, ``Just one shoe~ I can see by the boxes you wear that you need at least a pair.''\footnote{I let my wife read this manuscript. She hated it!
She asked me why my writing was so much ``worse'' than Pacoitz' -- I had to explain to her that Pacoitz fabricates content and that I was staying true to the source material and that my writing was better no matter how you look at it. But even so, she said that she did not care and that she preferred that I would keep my editorial notes out of it.

Well, I can make stuff up too, in fact I will, I'll be a better bad translator that Pacoitz could ever even dream to be.}

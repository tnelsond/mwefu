\chapter*{Note from the Editor-in-Chief}
Robert Graft, who is the junior editor in charge of editing this work, despises this particular translation; he has very few allies and I hope you're not foolish enough to be one of them. This translation, while differing from the original on many points, is traditional and a part of our culture in a way that the newer translations never will be (despite their accuracy).

However, Robert Graft's notes are very informative and interesting to say the least.

\chapter*{Foreword by the Editor}
\emph{The Fall of King Mwefu} is a good story; except this translation is not.
It may have seemed like a decent enough translation back in 1909 when Allen G. Pacoitz first translated it and he was the only scholar who could even read the language of Fo\-bwa.
Nevertheless, many people, who were intrigued by the story, learned to read Fo\-bwa so that they could enjoy \emph{The Fall of King Mwefu} in its original language.
And when they did, they realized that Pacoitz was inserting his own ideas and removing important content like a mad man.
The only reason this edition even exists is because despite the protest of many Fo\-bwa scholars, Pacoitz's translation is still the most popular translation in schools and in the home. 

There are now many more scholars studying the Fo\-bwa language and we now have much better translations;
do yourself a favor, drop this book right now and go out and buy \emph{The Fall of King Mwefu: Faithful Edition} from \emph{Whinery Press}, it is true to the original work, and in the oppinion of many is a much much better narrative.
Actually I don't really even care if you buy it from us at \emph{Whinery Press} or not.
As long as it's not translated by Allen G. Pacoitz you should be fine.
Note, however, that due to the nature of the Fo\-bwa language (and its total lack of word order) other publishers might call their translations \emph{King Shunwe's Descension} or any number of things. The name Mwefu itself could also be rendered (using the Pacoitz phonology) as Nweshu, Hungwe, or Fumwe; and there are also completely different phonologies out there such as the Joshua phonology where the sounds are scientifically reconstructed from phrases that are thought to be borrowed from Hebrew; so this is something to look out for in other publishers' translations. In \emph{The Fall of King Mwefu: Faithful Edition} most of the names differ from Pacoitz's because he had absolutely no consistency. Sometimes Pacoitz used the verb form of a name or worse, half the name would be in one form and the other half of it would be in another; sometimes he'd ignore putting the name in all together and substitute it with the name of a noun from English.

If for some reason you actually want to read this edition, for historical purposes or some other nonsense, then by all means read my footnotes where I point out all of Pacoitz's inaccuracies. And whenever I refer to the \emph{original} I'm referring to the original Fo\-bwa text.

\chapter{Maps}
\section{Pacoitz'}
I don't need to tell you that Pacoitz' map is worthless; there is only two place names written on the whole thing, the terrain is vague and there is only two rivers? I think Pacoitz just made this up, but he didn't even make it up based off of the places described in the text.

\section{Graft's}
I grew tired of looking at Pacoitz' map so I made my own using hints from the text. It's more accurate and way more informative, however, I did take some liberties.
